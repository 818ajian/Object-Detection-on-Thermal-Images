   2. Medium Article that compliments code repo: https://medium.com/@joehoeller/object-detection-on-thermal-images-f9526237686a

   3. Go into ```/data``` folder and unzip ```labels.zip```

#### Instructions

- Must have NVIDIA GPUs with CUDA X installed.

- The data provided by FLIR is included in the folder ```/coco/FLIR_Dataset```. 

- Place the custom pre-trained weights you downloaded from abovein ```/weights/*.pt``` 

- Converted labels from the [Dark Chocolate](https://github.com/joehoeller/Dark-Chocolate) repo are located in data/labels.

- The custom *.cfg with modified hyperparams is located in ```/cfg/yolov3-spp-r.cfg```.

- Class names and custom data is in ```/data/custom.names``` and ```custom.data```.


#### Install & Run Code:

After download is complete run pip install requirements, or click into the requriements.txt file for the Anaconda commands.
Install COCO: ``` bash yolov3/data/get_coco_dataset.sh```, then add FLIR images to: ```/coco/images/FLIR_Dataset``` where you. Select any random grouping of non-annotated images, (ctrl-click any random sample of 5 to 10, or 20 if you like), copy them, and them paste them into data/samples folder.

- Go back to the root of the project where the requirements.txt file is and open a command prompt, run the following:
```python3 detect.py --data data/custom.data --cfg cfg/yolov3-spp-r.cfg --weights weights/custom.pt```

- At the root of the project, you will then see a folder named output get generated with annotated images and bounding boxes around the objects within the images you chose for the data/samples folder.

- To get metrics, go back into command line at root of project and run: 
  $ ```python (python cmd prompt)```
  $ ```from utils import utils```
  $ ```utils.plot_results()```

You will then see an image of charts get generated at root of project called results.png

To get class-wise scores run: ```python3 test.py --cfg cfg/yolov3-spp-r.cfg --weights weights/custom.pt --data data/custom.data```
